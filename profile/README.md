## Traceability Report Format (TRF)

TRF is a neutral, deterministic, validator-verifiable evidence pack covering safety (ISO 26262), cybersecurity (ISO 21434/UNECE R155), OTA/software updates (ISO 24089/UNECE R156), and linked artifacts including requirements, tests, SBOM/VEX entries, and OTA deltas.

## Focus
- Steward the open TRF specification and supporting toolchain.
- Sequence: Publish → Demo → OEM Pilot → Technical Service acceptance → Open consortium.
- Deliverables: TRF specification, validator CLI, portable viewer, demo/negative packs, OEM pilot kits, governance and licensing guidance.

## Roadmap Snapshot
| Phase | Milestone Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| Foundation | Publish the open spec, ship validator CLI, release reproducible demo and negative packs, document governance. |
| Auditor Experience | Deliver portable viewer, stopwatch demo kit, and scripted auditor walkthroughs. |
| Validation & Outreach | Run technical-service demos, stand up OEM pilot programs, iterate on sampling and delta views. |
| Public Adoption | Share case notes, stabilize the spec for pilots, launch OpenTRF consortium assets. |

## How We Engage
- **Technical Services:** time-boxed stopwatch demos, negative-control walk-throughs, shadow-run support.
- **OEMs & Suppliers:** scoped pilots, deterministic pack exporters, acceptance phrasing aligned with independent sampling.

## Call for Participation
- TRF is an open, community-driven standard. We invite certified safety, cybersecurity, and compliance experts to review the spec, validate tooling, and share domain requirements.
- In the AI era, provable evidence chains are critical to distinguish human-audited compliance from synthetic output. Contribute test data, audit scenarios, and assurance cases to keep TRF trustworthy.
- Collaborate with us on sampling policies, negative controls, and tool qualification dossiers so TRF reflects real-world assessment practice.
